INSTRUCTIONS

Step 1: Verify the DOB

If the idol is U-12, you can somewhat skip this step. Make sure the DOB is correct however.

Before you add an idol to the database, make sure her DOB isn't fake. Do not use information found on covers unless it is the absolute only thing you can find.

Wikipedia is a decent source. The official website of the agency can also be considered accurate (though some definitely lie). Make sure to hunt for birthday posts on twitter/ameblo/blogs that could validate this DOB. Try to find other names the idol could have had to make sure her DOB isn't different. Once you have digged enough and found information that is the most accurate to the best of your ability, then you can proceed to the next step. Make sure to save the source of the DOB.

Step 2: Adding the idol

Download the database_shared.xlsx file found in RELEASES > database. You will need Microsoft Excel to open this file. If you don't have Excel or an alternate software (do not use Google Sheets), PM on Discord.

Once opened, add the information in the Idols tab. In the "Unsure DOB" column, write Yes if your only source is the cover, or something found on the official website (basically same reliability level as the cover) of the company or if said DOB seems fishy to you. It is basically to indicate that you cannot be sure of that DOB, no matter how much you tried to confirm it.

Step 3: Adding the movies

On the Movies tab, you can now add the movies of that idol. 

It is important that before adding anything to this tab, you make sure you have found all of the movies for that idol.

Websites you should use are :

* u15dvdinfo.com (best source of U-15 movies)

* eic-book.com (great source for most movies)

* idolwatch.jp (can be a great source, but lacks movie code)

* idolerotic.net (a bit more random, useful for more recent idols)

* wikipedia

Check all these to make sure you haven't forgotten anything then add each movie code and it's release date. Type the name of the idol in the appropriate column.

The file will automatically display the Age based on what you added in the Idols tab beforehand.
